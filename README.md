## Reflection 
>The main benefit I got from these projects was getting better at managing my projects, from organization to general time management. I learned to better organize my projects to increase my efficiency, and set realistic expectations for myself so I could complete my assignments in a timely manner.

## Development
>This is the most difficult code I've worked on this year. It uses selenium libraries to iterate through potential divs to find a specified quiz, based on a String input earlier in the program. It was difficult using xpath expressions since I had never used them prior to this project. I also had limited quizes to practice on since Dr. R was more concerned about the legal ramifications of creating a quiz taker than my development as a software engineer.

```Java
 boolean searching=true;
 	for(int i=1;searching;i++) {
		try {
		WebElement quiz = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id=\"course-profile-materials\"]/div[2]/div/div["+i+"]/div/div[3]/div[1]/a"));
		if(quiz.getText().equals(assignName)) {
			searching=false;
			driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id=\"course-profile-materials\"]/div[2]/div/div["+i+"]/div/div[3]/div[1]/a")).click();
			}
		} catch(NoSuchElementException e) {
			searching=false;
			System.out.println("quiz ("+assignName+") not found");
      			driver.quit();
		}
	}
```

## Processes
>When I'm presented with a problem, the first thing I do is plan the structure of the program, without writing it. Once I have an idea of how I want to organize the code, I start planning individual methods. I'll use scratch paper to sketch it out, check the API and look for existing methods that I can use to solve the problem in the most efficient way possible. Once I start writing the actual code, I'll set goals for myself, i.e. finish these 3 methods today, finish this class by the end of the week, etc. When I run into problems, first I'll look for how people with similar problems approached it, and if I can apply it to my program. If that doesn't work, I'll try asking my friends how they would do it, compare solutions, and try to work towards a promise. <br> After working out bugs and ensuring my project meets given requirements, I work on organization and refinement, making the program more efficient, and easier to understand.
